# Java OOP Zoo Ecosystem Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a simulation of a zoo ecosystem built using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It features a class hierarchy of animals, including behavior simulation and user interaction via the console.

Originally created for a school assignment, this project also serves as a demonstration of professional OOP structuring using concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, encapsulation, and validation.

## 🧱 Key Features

- Abstract base class: `Animal`
- Inheritance hierarchy: `Animal → Mammal/Bird → Lion, Elephant, Parrot, Eagle`
- Interface: `AnimalBehavior` implemented by all animal types
- Method overriding (`makeSound()`, `eat()`, `sleep()`, etc.)
- Animal properties such as `name`, `age`, `weight`, `habitat`, and `threat level`
- Polymorphic behavior in the `ZooSimulation` class
- Encapsulation demonstrated via `displayInfo()` and private fields
- Input validation example in a separate `Registration` class

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git / GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matbishop333/java_oop_project.git 
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred IDE.
3. Run `ZooSimulation.java` to simulate the zoo and test all the behaviors.
4. Run `Registration.java` to test the input validation system.
